    <h1> <strong> GIT COMMANDS </strong></h1>
    <p> This is my first time getting to learn the git commands. the following are some commands commonly used in git:</p>
    <li> Git commit: always goes a message. it is used to stage the changes made to the repo</li>
    <li> Git clone: used to clone a repo from GitHub</li>
    <li> Git commit -a -m "" : used to stage even very small changes to the repo</li>
